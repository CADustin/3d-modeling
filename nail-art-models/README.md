# Nail Art Models
OpenSCAD 3D Models that I've made for my Wife -- most of these were made with customizers so she could shared with friends.

## Nailfe Nail Art Disk (nailfie-nail-art-disk.scad)
Supports various customizations (name, instagram handle, Left vs. Right, size, etc).

There are also a couple of presets for things like:
1. Blank Left Hand (useful to pull into a program like Bambu Studio to customize further)
2. Blank Right Hand (useful to pull into a program like Bambu Studio to customize further)
2. Blank Ambi (If you do not plan to put text on it)

### Printing Notes

#### Printing with Text
When slicing I found it was important to use Arachne for the Wall Generator -- otherwise the text might not slice correctly.

#### Coloring Text without a Multi-Color printer 
One option to make the text pop with some color, is to paint it after printing -- since the text is raised, this is actually fairly easy to do.

### Ideas for future changes/contributions
1. It would be nice to allow setting the finger positions. This is what lead to us creating one ourselves, all the available models were a little uncomfortable to use and to get nice pictures like she wanted.
2. Figure out presets for different hand size (maybe based off of common glove sizes (S, M, L, XL)?
